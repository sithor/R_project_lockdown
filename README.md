# R_project_lockdown

This is a shiny app which explores data related to the effect of lockdowns in the US, by State. The app is <a href="https://sithor.shinyapps.io/lockdown/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The data was provided from Prof. Wilfred Reilly from Kentucky State University after reading his article
in spiked magazine [here](https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/04/22/there-is-no-empirical-evidence-for-these-lockdowns/).

The two explanatory variables are whether or not the State is under lockdown (0 = no lockdown; 1 = lockdown), and the other is population density,
either weighted (discounts very low density areas) or raw. The updated Covid-19 deaths or cases are pulled from [this](https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/current.csv) online source.

The app is by [Simon Thornley](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/s-thornley), Epidemiologist at the University of Auckland.

An explanation of the app is given in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cB_DEbXrhE&feature=youtu.be&t=721) with the motivation and an explanation of the app given from the 12 minute mark. The app renders much better on a computer monitor compared to a tablet or smart phone. Also, interactive 'hover' functionality works with a mouse, but not a touch screen.
