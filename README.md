# R_project_lockdown

This is a shiny app which explores data related to the effect of lockdowns in the US, by State. 

The data was provided from Prof. Wilfred Reilly at Kentucky State University after reading his article
in spiked magazine [here](https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/04/22/there-is-no-empirical-evidence-for-these-lockdowns/).

The two explanatory variables are whether or not the State is under lockdown (0 = no lockdown; 1 = lockdown), and the other is population density,
either weighted (discounts very low density areas) or raw. The updated Covid-19 deaths or cases are pulled from [this](https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/current.csv) online source.

The app is by [Dr Simon Thornley](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/s-thornley), Epidemiologist at the University of Auckland.
